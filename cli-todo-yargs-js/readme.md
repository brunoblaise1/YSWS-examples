# CLi YSWS Example of using yargs using options

This is another example of using options while developing Cli tools to use this one you can use it in multpile ways.

### Ways of Installing:

- `npm i cli-todo-yargs -g` and then after `cli-todo-yargs -n "Finish homework" "Study math" -l`
- `npx cli-todo-yargs  -n "Finish homework" "Study math" -l`

Either way work perfectly
