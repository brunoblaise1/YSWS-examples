# TODO RUST CLI

In this repo they are two folders one is a `todo-cli` and another is called `tools`, so `tools` are basic command we know like `Echo` and `Cat`


# Installation

If you have rust on your system clone this repo and then `cd` into it after that run `cargo run` and that's it, same goes for `tools`.

Another way you can run is through `cargo install cli-todo-rust` but it won't include the `tools` folder. I suggest doing the first step.


But that's not the only way we can test our programs, we can even use binary  by using `cargo build` I won't use it in this example but that is also an option.
